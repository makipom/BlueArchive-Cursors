### <p align="center"> <b> Regular Edition </b> </p>
#### Latest Release ▷ [Blue Archive Cursor Set v0.4.1](https://github.com/makipom/BlueArchive-Cursors/releases/tag/v0.4.1)
Cursors made to complement the design tones of the smartphone game [`Blue Archive`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Archive), as well as other official sources connected to it.

As you can see from the version number - this is an early release; probably will have to rework some of them from the ground up when time comes.
